### Links and Email
#### Inline
Just put angle brackets around an email and it becomes clickable: <uranusjr@gmail.com>  
`<uranusjr@gmail.com>`  

Same thing with urls: <http://macdown.uranusjr.com>  
` <http://macdown.uranusjr.com>`  

Perhaps you want to some link text like this: [Macdown Website](http://macdown.uranusjr.com "Title")  
`[Macdown Website](http://macdown.uranusjr.com "Title")` (The title is optional)  


#### Reference style
Sometimes it looks too messy to include big long urls inline, or you want to keep all your urls together.  

Make [a link][arbitrary_id] `[a link][arbitrary_id]` then on it's own line anywhere else in the file:  
`[arbitrary_id]: http://macdown.uranusjr.com "Title"`
  
If the link text itself would make a good id, you can link [like this][] `[like this][]`, then on it's own line anywhere else in the file:  
`[like this]: http://macdown.uranusjr.com`  

[arbitrary_id]: http://macdown.uranusjr.com "Title"
[like this]: http://macdown.uranusjr.com
